%    This function contains three input data of square matrices of the form 
%    MxM (in our results we studied the M=512 case), which should be images
%    transformed into Gray Tones (GT) of double type. In variable "X" we 
%    have the ROI (Region of Interest) in the medical image, in "Y" we have
%    a binary mask delimiting the ROI cell (SARS-CoV-2 cell). In variable 
%    "Z" we have the periodic pattern inducing periodicity, which are as 
%    important as the variable X, since otherwise it is not possible to 
%    simulate the Takeda's Method. The output from the function (Res) is
%    the unwrapped phase of the cell in the ROI of the medica image. We 
%    bear in mind that we aim to obtain the phase in all frames from the 
%    obtained phase of the information from a single frame in a 3D 
%    tomographic image, to finally obtain a 3D model.
%
%    In this work, we analyze the majority of objects digitization or 3D
%    reconstruction techniques, considering from these the Takeda method 
%    (Fringes Projection or Fourier Transform Method) by its simplicity. We
%    induce a periodicity in the images to subsequently simulate the Takeda
%    Method, filtering the periodic noise and finally unwrapping the phase.
%    This work was carried out in collaboration with Dra. Lilia Cedillo and 
%    Dr. Ygnacio Mart√≠nez, who greatly supported the interpretation of the 
%    results. The videos of the tomographic image were obtained in the
%    research entitled "Live imaging of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice
%    reveals that neutralizing antibodies require Fc function for optimal
%    efficacy";  with DOI: 10.1016/j.immuni.2021.08.015
